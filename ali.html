                    <p>
                        Ali is from the town of <strong class="strongMilestone">Kantchari</strong>, in Burkina Faso. He was working and completing a master's degree in Law at the University of Ouagadougou in 2004, when he was approached by a media company named All-Africa, which was seeking to open a branch in the city of Lagos, Nigeria. Ali finished his degree before heading to Lagos to accept the job. He had never been to Nigeria before, and was very curious to see what it was like, but he was also hesitant because of the uncertainty of not knowing what to expect. He moved from <strong class="strongMilestone">Ouagadougou</strong> to <strong class="strongMilestone">Lagos</strong> in 2005, traveling by road with all the requisite documents he would need.

                    <p>
                        There are many <strong class="strongBorder">borders</strong> between Burkina Faso and Nigeria. Ali drove through Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo and Benin to get to his destination. At times, he took a longer <strong class="strongRoute">route</strong> through Ivory Coast; other times, he went through Togo or Benin. Because of the numerous borders, he developed a wealth of experience about freedom of movement in the region.

                        Trained to be a lawyer, Ali is cognizant of ECOWAS freedom of movement rights. As a result, he often challenges immigration officers at the borders whenever he encounters extortion or harassment. His outspokenness has gotten him into standoffs with officers a few times.

While working in media, he also tapped into the need for French education in the city. He taught journalism to students in the French department at the University of Lagos (UNILAG). He also established a French language news program. His job in media takes him all over the continent, and he has had stints in Kenya, Tunisia, Senegal, Ethiopia, Cameroon, and elsewhere.

                        As time passed, Ali tried to adapt to life in Lagos. He lived in <strong class="strongMilestone">Dolphin Estate</strong>, one of the first gated communities in Lagos Island. He was supposed to leave Nigeria and join the All-Africa office in Dakar, Senegal, but he did not like the idea of moving from Lagos because the project he was doing at UNILAG was very fascinating. Without him, the project would have stopped. The French Embassy and the university asked him to stay, and he negotiated the terms and remained in Lagos.

He is an active member in the Burkinabe community in Lagos.
