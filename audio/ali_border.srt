1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
I travel a lot by car.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,240
I go to Burkina Faso, driving from Lagos to Burkina Faso,

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,600
from Lagos to Abidjan, I go.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,840
How is that like the?

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,840
Yes, very interesting.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,920
Crossing the border.

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,880
Very, very, very.

8
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,080
Yes, constantly.

9
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,720
I have stories, don't I?

10
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,440
I have stories.

11
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,000
Even one immigration guy from Benengubi

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,560
threatened to shoot in his office,

13
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,240
that I should get out of his office.

14
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,120
Otherwise, he would shoot, I say shoot.

15
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,960
I'm here, because anyway, you know,

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,320
because I'm a journalist.

17
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,360
So, most times, they are a bit careful, you understand.

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,360
But that guy, they are not telling that I'm a journalist.

19
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,440
I wanted to see what is going to happen.

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,280
But...
