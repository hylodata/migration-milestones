I travel a lot by car.
I go to Burkina Faso, driving from Lagos to Burkina Faso,
from Lagos to Abidjan, I go.
How is that like the?
Yes, very interesting.
Crossing the border.
Very, very, very.
Yes, constantly.
I have stories, don't I?
I have stories.
Even one immigration guy from Benengubi
threatened to shoot in his office,
that I should get out of his office.
Otherwise, he would shoot, I say shoot.
I'm here, because anyway, you know,
because I'm a journalist.
So, most times, they are a bit careful, you understand.
But that guy, they are not telling that I'm a journalist.
I wanted to see what is going to happen.
But...
