00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
I travel a lot by car.

00:02.400 --> 00:05.240
I go to Burkina Faso, driving from Lagos to Burkina Faso,

00:05.240 --> 00:06.600
from Lagos to Abidjan, I go.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.840
How is that like the?

00:08.840 --> 00:09.840
Yes, very interesting.

00:09.840 --> 00:10.920
Crossing the border.

00:10.920 --> 00:11.880
Very, very, very.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.080
Yes, constantly.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.720
I have stories, don't I?

00:14.720 --> 00:15.440
I have stories.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.000
Even one immigration guy from Benengubi

00:18.000 --> 00:21.560
threatened to shoot in his office,

00:21.560 --> 00:23.240
that I should get out of his office.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.120
Otherwise, he would shoot, I say shoot.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.960
I'm here, because anyway, you know,

00:30.000 --> 00:31.320
because I'm a journalist.

00:31.320 --> 00:35.360
So, most times, they are a bit careful, you understand.

00:35.360 --> 00:38.360
But that guy, they are not telling that I'm a journalist.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.440
I wanted to see what is going to happen.

00:41.440 --> 00:42.280
But...
