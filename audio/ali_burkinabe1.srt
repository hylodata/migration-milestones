1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
Let's say we can have a community, today I can, okay from the registration you have at the embassy

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,040
because all of them they're not even going there to register and all of them they're supposed to

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:21,760
do that but no. We are around let's say 600, 600 in Lagos here but you have some in some other

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,440
states like you have the consulate now is a new consulate and even this consulate we are the one

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,120
at the association that requested from our government to put a consulate here so that people

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,240
can go and do their papers there to understand because before we had to rely on the embassy

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:46,400
embassy which is in Labriger and there was just a liaison office economic liaison office here

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,520
that was helping with those things but we didn't hire we have to do it so that people can get the

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,520
right you know so you have six other states that vary from Lagos

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,800
you have ocean state, oil state

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,840
I'm getting those six in fact in the south here okay yeah

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:29,520
so it's basically the south west? Yes basically the south west

13
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,160
the east side they depend on Lagos and very soon we're going to have another one another

14
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:44,480
consulate that coming for the not people
