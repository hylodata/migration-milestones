00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
Let's say we can have a community, today I can, okay from the registration you have at the embassy

00:06.880 --> 00:11.040
because all of them they're not even going there to register and all of them they're supposed to

00:11.040 --> 00:21.760
do that but no. We are around let's say 600, 600 in Lagos here but you have some in some other

00:21.760 --> 00:27.440
states like you have the consulate now is a new consulate and even this consulate we are the one

00:27.520 --> 00:33.120
at the association that requested from our government to put a consulate here so that people

00:33.120 --> 00:38.240
can go and do their papers there to understand because before we had to rely on the embassy

00:38.240 --> 00:46.400
embassy which is in Labriger and there was just a liaison office economic liaison office here

00:46.400 --> 00:51.520
that was helping with those things but we didn't hire we have to do it so that people can get the

00:52.320 --> 00:57.520
right you know so you have six other states that vary from Lagos

00:58.480 --> 01:00.800
you have ocean state, oil state

01:08.880 --> 01:13.840
I'm getting those six in fact in the south here okay yeah

01:14.160 --> 01:29.520
so it's basically the south west? Yes basically the south west

01:31.920 --> 01:38.160
the east side they depend on Lagos and very soon we're going to have another one another

01:38.160 --> 01:44.480
consulate that coming for the not people
