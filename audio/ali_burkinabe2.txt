People didn't care because when they come here, the society is so open that nobody's going to ask you where you're coming from.
Provided you speak your English or you can interact with them, most of us, they think we are not like when I say Alicabre.
I say Alicabre. Some people, even in official paper, they write Alicabre.
I say Agamilicabre, Nakabre, correct it.
But because, no, everybody is like, we are the same. If you say your name, it sounds like some, ah, okay, are you from Zogotubu?
No, no, I'm from Okinawa so, ah, Okinawa, good, good, good, good, good, you know.
So, to me, it's a very open society. People are very welcoming.
People are, you know, no issue, no stigmatization, no, no, I can't say that, I can't say that from the experience I had.
