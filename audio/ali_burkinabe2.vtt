People didn't care because when they come here, the society is so open that nobody's going to ask you where you're coming from.

00:07.800 --> 00:14.240
Provided you speak your English or you can interact with them, most of us, they think we are not like when I say Alicabre.

00:14.240 --> 00:18.400
I say Alicabre. Some people, even in official paper, they write Alicabre.

00:18.400 --> 00:22.800
I say Agamilicabre, Nakabre, correct it.

00:22.800 --> 00:32.320
But because, no, everybody is like, we are the same. If you say your name, it sounds like some, ah, okay, are you from Zogotubu?

00:32.320 --> 00:37.880
No, no, I'm from Okinawa so, ah, Okinawa, good, good, good, good, good, you know.

00:37.880 --> 00:43.360
So, to me, it's a very open society. People are very welcoming.

00:43.360 --> 00:52.040
People are, you know, no issue, no stigmatization, no, no, I can't say that, I can't say that from the experience I had.
