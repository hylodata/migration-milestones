I know, even through him, I help some of our foreigners, not from Burkina, a guy from
Niger, a guy from Ivacos, the last from Al-Ghut, Ivacos, and I help them to go through him
and do their paper.
He's a very simple person, so I don't know too much, although it was very expensive.
Now, today, it's easier to do because you can just go on the internet and fill your things
and you pay online and everything.
You pay online, it's not something that's very difficult to do, but then it was a bit
expensive, but you pay once a month, so I think I paid around $60,000 or $70,000 to set up
a business name.
