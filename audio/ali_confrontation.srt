1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
I was just going for a while to know I used to go and relax.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,080
Friday I would go and come back Monday morning early.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,320
So I went and I packed my car and the burdens.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,320
And I want to cross just with that.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,440
My paper was not fine at that time.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,480
So I just packed my car to give the paper.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,000
So I saw the guy who was collecting money from people

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,840
with the paper stamping going.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,440
So I looked at it.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,400
When I came to him, he didn't even look at me.

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,920
He put his hand like that.

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,760
I now bend like that.

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,320
Sorry, sir.

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,080
This is my passport to stamp.

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,080
He said, hey.

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,320
So you're not seeing the order.

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,920
What they are doing, you know they see him.

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,520
OK, if you don't see him, go and sit down there.

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,400
You're not ready to go.

20
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,240
Don't worry.

21
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,600
And I went and sit down.

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,160
I sat and after like 15 minutes, I was like,

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,000
I was just looking at what is going on.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,560
And I said, OK.

25
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,440
I saw now a guy who came.

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,760
They came with their boss.

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,400
The man took a long grocery, took the passport.

28
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,400
Maybe 30 or 50, I don't know, but it was 20.

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,120
And he went, he enters from the back of the office

30
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,600
of the guy, the immigration guy.

31
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,720
And he gave him money.

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,920
The man just took it.

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,680
He was just, you can see the paper, paper, paper, paper.

34
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,400
You're stamping, stamping, stamping.

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,680
I said, ah, good.

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,200
Good idea.

37
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,240
So me too, I went to the back.

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,880
And I waited.

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,440
When he finished, I entered.

40
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,800
I said, I'm sorry.

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,520
So he saw me, he said, what are you doing here?

42
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,680
I said, ah, OK.

43
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,880
I told you to, I have, because before that,

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,960
I went back again after 15 minutes to talk to him

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,680
that, OK, stamp my passport there.

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,720
Let me go.

47
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,800
He said, no, if I'm not paying, I should just leave it

48
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,360
and we'll go.

49
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,840
I said, OK, no, I can't pay.

50
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,360
I don't have the money to pay.

51
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
I said, you don't have the money.

52
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,480
Go ahead, sit down.

53
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,920
So I went back there.

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,760
So it is then now I saw the man now doing that.

55
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,200
And I came in.

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,000
I said, ah, he said, what's happening?

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,800
What are you doing in my office?

58
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
I said, no, OK.

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,360
I saw this man just enter here.

60
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,080
I see that you are doing it fast, fast, fast.

61
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,680
So I thought maybe when you enter here, they do it.

62
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,600
That's why I came.

63
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,560
He said, get out of my office.

64
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,440
I'm not signing.

65
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,920
I'll take your passport and go.

66
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,600
Just go.

67
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,240
I said, ah, no, I cannot do that.

68
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,600
I need to stamp.

69
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,120
Because when I'm going out, I need to know that I'm outside.

70
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,520
When I come in, I have to sign.

71
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,960
The man said, no, I should get out of his office now.

72
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,640
Before he gets there, I said, ah, OK.

73
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm seriously going to stamp my passport.

74
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
I cannot go.

75
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
I will shoot at you.

76
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
He just stood up there.

77
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,400
And he said, if you annoy me now, I said, no, I cannot do it.

78
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,040
So I started shouting.

79
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,760
His colleague now, from there, now, he came now.

80
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
That, ah, what is happening?

81
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,920
What is happening?

82
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,360
The man is, he was, he holds now, like 60 something.

83
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,280
He said, ah, look at this young man.

84
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,400
He comes here in my office, he wants to embarrass me.

85
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,080
He's abusing me.

86
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,280
He's talking to me anyhow.

87
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,640
I said, ah, the police were there.

88
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,080
Even the organ came, Sam.

89
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,880
He's even, he passed four years ago.

90
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,200
Sam came down, the came, they were like, oh, I said, no,

91
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,880
me too, I said, no, I did not, you're my father's age.

92
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,920
I can't abuse you with the education I have.

93
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,200
I can never abuse you, I can never abuse you.

94
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,760
I told you to just stamp my passport.

95
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,400
He said, I should pay before I stamp.

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,920
I said, I cannot pay for that.

97
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,960
The organ said, OK, come, come, give me the passport.

98
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,720
I'm going to pass my two kids.
