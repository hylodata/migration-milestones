0	3720	I was just going for a while to know I used to go and relax.
3720	7080	Friday I would go and come back Monday morning early.
7080	11320	So I went and I packed my car and the burdens.
11320	13320	And I want to cross just with that.
13320	15440	My paper was not fine at that time.
15440	18480	So I just packed my car to give the paper.
18480	22000	So I saw the guy who was collecting money from people
22000	23840	with the paper stamping going.
23840	25440	So I looked at it.
25440	28400	When I came to him, he didn't even look at me.
28400	30920	He put his hand like that.
30920	32760	I now bend like that.
32760	35320	Sorry, sir.
35320	37080	This is my passport to stamp.
37080	38080	He said, hey.
38080	39320	So you're not seeing the order.
39320	40920	What they are doing, you know they see him.
40920	42520	OK, if you don't see him, go and sit down there.
42520	43400	You're not ready to go.
43400	44240	Don't worry.
44240	45600	And I went and sit down.
45600	50160	I sat and after like 15 minutes, I was like,
50160	52000	I was just looking at what is going on.
52000	53560	And I said, OK.
53560	55440	I saw now a guy who came.
55440	57760	They came with their boss.
57760	61400	The man took a long grocery, took the passport.
61400	64400	Maybe 30 or 50, I don't know, but it was 20.
64400	68120	And he went, he enters from the back of the office
68120	70600	of the guy, the immigration guy.
70600	72720	And he gave him money.
72720	73920	The man just took it.
73920	76680	He was just, you can see the paper, paper, paper, paper.
76680	78400	You're stamping, stamping, stamping.
78400	79680	I said, ah, good.
79680	80200	Good idea.
80200	82240	So me too, I went to the back.
82240	82880	And I waited.
82880	84440	When he finished, I entered.
84440	85800	I said, I'm sorry.
85840	89520	So he saw me, he said, what are you doing here?
89520	90680	I said, ah, OK.
90680	92880	I told you to, I have, because before that,
92880	94960	I went back again after 15 minutes to talk to him
94960	97680	that, OK, stamp my passport there.
97680	98720	Let me go.
98720	100800	He said, no, if I'm not paying, I should just leave it
100800	101360	and we'll go.
101360	104840	I said, OK, no, I can't pay.
104840	106360	I don't have the money to pay.
106360	107360	I said, you don't have the money.
107360	108480	Go ahead, sit down.
108480	109920	So I went back there.
109920	113760	So it is then now I saw the man now doing that.
113800	115200	And I came in.
115200	117000	I said, ah, he said, what's happening?
117000	117800	What are you doing in my office?
117800	119000	I said, no, OK.
119000	120360	I saw this man just enter here.
120360	122080	I see that you are doing it fast, fast, fast.
122080	124680	So I thought maybe when you enter here, they do it.
124680	125600	That's why I came.
125600	126560	He said, get out of my office.
126560	127440	I'm not signing.
127440	128920	I'll take your passport and go.
128920	129600	Just go.
129600	131240	I said, ah, no, I cannot do that.
131240	132600	I need to stamp.
132600	135120	Because when I'm going out, I need to know that I'm outside.
135120	137520	When I come in, I have to sign.
137520	139960	The man said, no, I should get out of his office now.
139960	141640	Before he gets there, I said, ah, OK.
141640	143120	I'm seriously going to stamp my passport.
143120	145120	I cannot go.
145120	146120	I will shoot at you.
146120	147120	He just stood up there.
147120	150400	And he said, if you annoy me now, I said, no, I cannot do it.
150400	152040	So I started shouting.
152040	154760	His colleague now, from there, now, he came now.
154760	155760	That, ah, what is happening?
155760	157920	What is happening?
157920	162360	The man is, he was, he holds now, like 60 something.
162360	164280	He said, ah, look at this young man.
164280	166400	He comes here in my office, he wants to embarrass me.
166400	167080	He's abusing me.
167080	168280	He's talking to me anyhow.
168280	170640	I said, ah, the police were there.
170640	173080	Even the organ came, Sam.

186920	189200	I can never abuse you, I can never abuse you.
189200	190760	I told you to just stamp my passport.
190760	192400	He said, I should pay before I stamp.
192400	194920	I said, I cannot pay for that.
194920	197960	The organ said, OK, come, come, give me the passport.
