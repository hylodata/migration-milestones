00:00.000 --> 00:03.720
I was just going for a while to know I used to go and relax.

00:03.720 --> 00:07.080
Friday I would go and come back Monday morning early.

00:07.080 --> 00:11.320
So I went and I packed my car and the burdens.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.320
And I want to cross just with that.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.440
My paper was not fine at that time.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.480
So I just packed my car to give the paper.

00:18.480 --> 00:22.000
So I saw the guy who was collecting money from people

00:22.000 --> 00:23.840
with the paper stamping going.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.440
So I looked at it.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.400
When I came to him, he didn't even look at me.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.920
He put his hand like that.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.760
I now bend like that.

00:32.760 --> 00:35.320
Sorry, sir.

00:35.320 --> 00:37.080
This is my passport to stamp.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.080
He said, hey.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.320
So you're not seeing the order.

00:39.320 --> 00:40.920
What they are doing, you know they see him.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.520
OK, if you don't see him, go and sit down there.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.400
You're not ready to go.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.240
Don't worry.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.600
And I went and sit down.

00:45.600 --> 00:50.160
I sat and after like 15 minutes, I was like,

00:50.160 --> 00:52.000
I was just looking at what is going on.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.560
And I said, OK.

00:53.560 --> 00:55.440
I saw now a guy who came.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.760
They came with their boss.

00:57.760 --> 01:01.400
The man took a long grocery, took the passport.

01:01.400 --> 01:04.400
Maybe 30 or 50, I don't know, but it was 20.

01:04.400 --> 01:08.120
And he went, he enters from the back of the office

01:08.120 --> 01:10.600
of the guy, the immigration guy.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.720
And he gave him money.

01:12.720 --> 01:13.920
The man just took it.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.680
He was just, you can see the paper, paper, paper, paper.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.400
You're stamping, stamping, stamping.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.680
I said, ah, good.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.200
Good idea.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.240
So me too, I went to the back.

01:22.240 --> 01:22.880
And I waited.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.440
When he finished, I entered.

01:24.440 --> 01:25.800
I said, I'm sorry.

01:25.840 --> 01:29.520
So he saw me, he said, what are you doing here?

01:29.520 --> 01:30.680
I said, ah, OK.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.880
I told you to, I have, because before that,

01:32.880 --> 01:34.960
I went back again after 15 minutes to talk to him

01:34.960 --> 01:37.680
that, OK, stamp my passport there.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.720
Let me go.

01:38.720 --> 01:40.800
He said, no, if I'm not paying, I should just leave it

01:40.800 --> 01:41.360
and we'll go.

01:41.360 --> 01:44.840
I said, OK, no, I can't pay.

01:44.840 --> 01:46.360
I don't have the money to pay.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.360
I said, you don't have the money.

01:47.360 --> 01:48.480
Go ahead, sit down.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.920
So I went back there.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.760
So it is then now I saw the man now doing that.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.200
And I came in.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.000
I said, ah, he said, what's happening?

01:57.000 --> 01:57.800
What are you doing in my office?

01:57.800 --> 01:59.000
I said, no, OK.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.360
I saw this man just enter here.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.080
I see that you are doing it fast, fast, fast.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.680
So I thought maybe when you enter here, they do it.

02:04.680 --> 02:05.600
That's why I came.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.560
He said, get out of my office.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.440
I'm not signing.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.920
I'll take your passport and go.

02:08.920 --> 02:09.600
Just go.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.240
I said, ah, no, I cannot do that.

02:11.240 --> 02:12.600
I need to stamp.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.120
Because when I'm going out, I need to know that I'm outside.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.520
When I come in, I have to sign.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.960
The man said, no, I should get out of his office now.

02:19.960 --> 02:21.640
Before he gets there, I said, ah, OK.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.120
I'm seriously going to stamp my passport.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.120
I cannot go.

02:25.120 --> 02:26.120
I will shoot at you.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.120
He just stood up there.

02:27.120 --> 02:30.400
And he said, if you annoy me now, I said, no, I cannot do it.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.040
So I started shouting.

02:32.040 --> 02:34.760
His colleague now, from there, now, he came now.

02:34.760 --> 02:35.760
That, ah, what is happening?

02:35.760 --> 02:37.920
What is happening?

02:37.920 --> 02:42.360
The man is, he was, he holds now, like 60 something.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.280
He said, ah, look at this young man.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.400
He comes here in my office, he wants to embarrass me.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.080
He's abusing me.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.280
He's talking to me anyhow.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.640
I said, ah, the police were there.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.080
Even the organ came, Sam.

02:53.080 --> 02:56.880
He's even, he passed four years ago.

02:56.880 --> 03:00.200
Sam came down, the came, they were like, oh, I said, no,

03:00.200 --> 03:03.880
me too, I said, no, I did not, you're my father's age.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.920
I can't abuse you with the education I have.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.200
I can never abuse you, I can never abuse you.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.760
I told you to just stamp my passport.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.400
He said, I should pay before I stamp.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.920
I said, I cannot pay for that.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.960
The organ said, OK, come, come, give me the passport.

03:17.960 --> 03:20.720
I'm going to pass my two kids.
