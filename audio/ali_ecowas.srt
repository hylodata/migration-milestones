1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,640
You see, it's like everywhere.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,280
It depends on where you are coming from, what is your aim, what is, what, what you are.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,720
When I came in here in Nigeria, my, my, my, my target was to spend two years here,

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,280
not more than two years and go back.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,160
But along the line, I, I got used to it and I saw that, okay, there are some other things that I can, you know,

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,960
to, to better my own, let's say, experience, professional experience.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:34,720
And even I also attended the Lagos Business School, you know, where I did the master's there too.

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:45,560
And I noticed that there's, as I said, Nigeria is like a laboratory to me, for me, the way I see it.

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:56,000
And from the experience I've seen in 2005 and today about Lagos, I can tell you, change, change is possible.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,320
When you set the right people in place to do the things, you know what I'm saying?

11
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,720
Whether in business or in politics, they are, here is a ground of opportunity.

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,080
You can do, you can grow your business.

13
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,840
If, if it works, you don't need a, a godfather to do business.

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,280
If you're good at what you're doing, it works.

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:29,800
So whatever you're doing, whichever area you are in business, when you do it well, you concentrate and you, you upgrade your skills,

16
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,360
you make your business ready to work because the market is there, the market is there.

17
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:46,840
So what's really to, I don't know if there's something specifically, but as a, as an African, because when you look at it,

18
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,760
Nigeria is part of a cause, and a cause is walking towards making a global, a kind of regional market, okay?

19
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:03,760
So whatever you have in your country that you can, you can sell to Nigeria or you can come to Nigeria, do it and sell back to your country.

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:14,200
Or like what I do, fixing, I help people, business people from, from some countries in Nigeria, those who want to, you know, transact, you know,

21
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,400
I help them, those who are looking for, they come here, they look for.

22
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,520
We have some of young Bukinabe guys at Lagos Island market.

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:29,080
They help the traders or market, market people to buy things and they put it on all those trucks and they send it and everything.

24
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,160
So, but they, some of them, some of them are organized there.

25
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:40,080
They do well, very well, but some are not very organized and they need that.

26
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,960
They need to really get organized to measure to what they are doing on the right side of Nigeria.
