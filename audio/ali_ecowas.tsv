0	1640	You see, it's like everywhere.
1640	5280	It depends on where you are coming from, what is your aim, what is, what, what you are.
5280	10720	When I came in here in Nigeria, my, my, my, my target was to spend two years here,
10720	14280	not more than two years and go back.
14280	21160	But along the line, I, I got used to it and I saw that, okay, there are some other things that I can, you know,
21160	26960	to, to better my own, let's say, experience, professional experience.
26960	34720	And even I also attended the Lagos Business School, you know, where I did the master's there too.
34720	45560	And I noticed that there's, as I said, Nigeria is like a laboratory to me, for me, the way I see it.
45560	56000	And from the experience I've seen in 2005 and today about Lagos, I can tell you, change, change is possible.
56000	61320	When you set the right people in place to do the things, you know what I'm saying?
61320	68720	Whether in business or in politics, they are, here is a ground of opportunity.
68720	71080	You can do, you can grow your business.
71080	75840	If, if it works, you don't need a, a godfather to do business.
75840	79280	If you're good at what you're doing, it works.
79280	89800	So whatever you're doing, whichever area you are in business, when you do it well, you concentrate and you, you upgrade your skills,
89800	94360	you make your business ready to work because the market is there, the market is there.
94360	106840	So what's really to, I don't know if there's something specifically, but as a, as an African, because when you look at it,
106880	114760	Nigeria is part of a cause, and a cause is walking towards making a global, a kind of regional market, okay?
114760	123760	So whatever you have in your country that you can, you can sell to Nigeria or you can come to Nigeria, do it and sell back to your country.
123760	134200	Or like what I do, fixing, I help people, business people from, from some countries in Nigeria, those who want to, you know, transact, you know,
134200	137400	I help them, those who are looking for, they come here, they look for.
137400	141520	We have some of young Bukinabe guys at Lagos Island market.
141520	149080	They help the traders or market, market people to buy things and they put it on all those trucks and they send it and everything.
149080	153160	So, but they, some of them, some of them are organized there.
153160	160080	They do well, very well, but some are not very organized and they need that.
160080	164960	They need to really get organized to measure to what they are doing on the right side of Nigeria.
