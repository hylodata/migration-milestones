1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Our people are ignorant of what is really normal, what to do, what not to do.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And me as a press man, okay, I will not just go and spoil your name or write something, I did not do that.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But at least, even them, I talk to them, okay, what you're doing is not right.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
At least, just do your job normally.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If I'm happy, I can give you something for you to have a drink.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
No problem, it's not an issue.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Don't force people, because I source to people also, they are standing.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
They don't have money, or the small money they have to travel.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Sometimes the money is not even complete yet.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You will come and take after that money.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You force them to pay something.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, anyway, I had this one and say my border.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I had it at Lome, from Kotonu to Lome.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I had it at the border with the Kotonu, Lome people.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We fought seriously.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I even tried to go to meet the ogre.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And I would take the matter to the ministry.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I told them that day, before they do my paper.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So it is just like, it's normal for them.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Everywhere, even Benet.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, Benet and Bukina Faso, not the same thing.
