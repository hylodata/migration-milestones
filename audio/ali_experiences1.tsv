0	6000	Our people are ignorant of what is really normal, what to do, what not to do.
6000	12000	And me as a press man, okay, I will not just go and spoil your name or write something, I did not do that.
12000	18000	But at least, even them, I talk to them, okay, what you're doing is not right.
18000	21000	At least, just do your job normally.
21000	24000	If I'm happy, I can give you something for you to have a drink.
24000	26000	No problem, it's not an issue.
26000	30000	Don't force people, because I source to people also, they are standing.
30000	33000	They don't have money, or the small money they have to travel.
33000	35000	Sometimes the money is not even complete yet.

55000	57000	We fought seriously.
57000	61000	I even tried to go to meet the ogre.
61000	64000	And I would take the matter to the ministry.
64000	67000	I told them that day, before they do my paper.
67000	70000	So it is just like, it's normal for them.
70000	72000	Everywhere, even Benet.
72000	75000	Yes, Benet and Bukina Faso, not the same thing.
