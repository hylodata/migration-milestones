00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Our people are ignorant of what is really normal, what to do, what not to do.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
And me as a press man, okay, I will not just go and spoil your name or write something, I did not do that.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
But at least, even them, I talk to them, okay, what you're doing is not right.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
At least, just do your job normally.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
If I'm happy, I can give you something for you to have a drink.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
No problem, it's not an issue.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Don't force people, because I source to people also, they are standing.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
They don't have money, or the small money they have to travel.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Sometimes the money is not even complete yet.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
You will come and take after that money.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
You force them to pay something.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
No.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Okay, anyway, I had this one and say my border.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
I had it at Lome, from Kotonu to Lome.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
I had it at the border with the Kotonu, Lome people.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
We fought seriously.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
I even tried to go to meet the ogre.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
And I would take the matter to the ministry.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
I told them that day, before they do my paper.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
So it is just like, it's normal for them.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Everywhere, even Benet.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Yes, Benet and Bukina Faso, not the same thing.
