1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Maybe Bukinabe did not distort me because I'm a Bukinabe, you understand?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,920
But then I probably, they distort me very well, and I told them the same thing.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,320
The man told me, he said, the generator that is there,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,840
how do you want that the power, how do you want that the fuel, fueling it?

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,040
I said, how does it concern me?

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,800
It doesn't concern me, no.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,840
Or if you want us to help you, take care of your generator,

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,280
just put the box there and put the paper, say,

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,080
help us to fuel our generator.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,960
I will put money.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,760
But here, I don't give you, even one cobalt, I don't give you.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,720
Okay, so you have instances like that, a lot of things that happen.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,320
How much was he asking for?

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:42,880
Pardon?

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,160
How much was he asking for?

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,560
In the Republic, it's 500 safer, 500 safer.

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,440
At the border here, in Kotonu, it's in between 200 and 500.

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,960
They can ask you anything like that.

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,160
It depends on how they, but I don't know if they are stopped now,

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,360
because for a while, they are not traveling from the road there.

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,360
Because of that road, that's not good at all.

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,360
So, I don't know if they are.

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,000
And they have also modernized the, how do you call it,

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,840
the joint immigration point.

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,880
So, it is now, the last time I saw it, it was very nice.

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,920
They started doing something.

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,840
What was the last time you were there?

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,960
The last time I went there was,

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,080
almost two years ago, almost two years ago, I didn't go there.

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Because I went, I actually went to Lomi,

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,680
not Kotonu, but I passed out in Lomi.

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:57,920
And it was, I think, around August, around August 2017.
