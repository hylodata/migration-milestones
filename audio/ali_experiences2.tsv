0	3680	Maybe Bukinabe did not distort me because I'm a Bukinabe, you understand?
3680	7920	But then I probably, they distort me very well, and I told them the same thing.
7920	10320	The man told me, he said, the generator that is there,
10320	15840	how do you want that the power, how do you want that the fuel, fueling it?
15840	19040	I said, how does it concern me?
19040	20800	It doesn't concern me, no.
20800	23840	Or if you want us to help you, take care of your generator,
23840	27280	just put the box there and put the paper, say,
27360	30080	help us to fuel our generator.
30080	30960	I will put money.
30960	33760	But here, I don't give you, even one cobalt, I don't give you.
36160	40720	Okay, so you have instances like that, a lot of things that happen.
40720	42320	How much was he asking for?
42320	42880	Pardon?
42880	44160	How much was he asking for?
44160	48560	In the Republic, it's 500 safer, 500 safer.
48560	53440	At the border here, in Kotonu, it's in between 200 and 500.
53440	54960	They can ask you anything like that.
57520	60160	It depends on how they, but I don't know if they are stopped now,
60160	63360	because for a while, they are not traveling from the road there.
63360	65360	Because of that road, that's not good at all.
65360	67360	So, I don't know if they are.
67360	72000	And they have also modernized the, how do you call it,
72000	75840	the joint immigration point.
75840	78880	So, it is now, the last time I saw it, it was very nice.
78880	79920	They started doing something.
79920	81840	What was the last time you were there?
82800	84960	The last time I went there was,
93440	98080	almost two years ago, almost two years ago, I didn't go there.
99760	103760	Because I went, I actually went to Lomi,
105360	107680	not Kotonu, but I passed out in Lomi.
107680	117920	And it was, I think, around August, around August 2017.
