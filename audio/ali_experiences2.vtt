Maybe Bukinabe did not distort me because I'm a Bukinabe, you understand?

00:03.680 --> 00:07.920
But then I probably, they distort me very well, and I told them the same thing.

00:07.920 --> 00:10.320
The man told me, he said, the generator that is there,

00:10.320 --> 00:15.840
how do you want that the power, how do you want that the fuel, fueling it?

00:15.840 --> 00:19.040
I said, how does it concern me?

00:19.040 --> 00:20.800
It doesn't concern me, no.

00:20.800 --> 00:23.840
Or if you want us to help you, take care of your generator,

00:23.840 --> 00:27.280
just put the box there and put the paper, say,

00:27.360 --> 00:30.080
help us to fuel our generator.

00:30.080 --> 00:30.960
I will put money.

00:30.960 --> 00:33.760
But here, I don't give you, even one cobalt, I don't give you.

00:36.160 --> 00:40.720
Okay, so you have instances like that, a lot of things that happen.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.320
How much was he asking for?

00:42.320 --> 00:42.880
Pardon?

00:42.880 --> 00:44.160
How much was he asking for?

00:44.160 --> 00:48.560
In the Republic, it's 500 safer, 500 safer.

00:48.560 --> 00:53.440
At the border here, in Kotonu, it's in between 200 and 500.

00:53.440 --> 00:54.960
They can ask you anything like that.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.160
It depends on how they, but I don't know if they are stopped now,

01:00.160 --> 01:03.360
because for a while, they are not traveling from the road there.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.360
Because of that road, that's not good at all.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.360
So, I don't know if they are.

01:07.360 --> 01:12.000
And they have also modernized the, how do you call it,

01:12.000 --> 01:15.840
the joint immigration point.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.880
So, it is now, the last time I saw it, it was very nice.

01:18.880 --> 01:19.920
They started doing something.

01:19.920 --> 01:21.840
What was the last time you were there?

01:22.800 --> 01:24.960
The last time I went there was,

01:33.440 --> 01:38.080
almost two years ago, almost two years ago, I didn't go there.

01:39.760 --> 01:43.760
Because I went, I actually went to Lomi,

01:45.360 --> 01:47.680
not Kotonu, but I passed out in Lomi.

01:47.680 --> 01:57.920
And it was, I think, around August, around August 2017.
