1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,520
I love my country so much that, to me, I have to capitalise on my experience in the country

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,440
to see what I can bring into my country, not only in terms of governance, because I have

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,840
a lot of relations with people, but also in terms of business, business model.

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:29,320
There are things, I saw some things here that are working, I suggest I give the ideas to

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,320
some of my friends there.

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:49,880
And some have made it, it's good, it's working, by myself, I'm like, okay, so what I'm doing

7
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:57,280
here, you know, is media, media work and, you know, I will see continue to do that, but

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,800
myself, after everything, I'm also preparing myself to go back home, not really to stay

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:10,640
here for no longer, to go back home and capitalise on what I've had with relations, with everything

10
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,680
and anyone who wants to come to Nigeria, I'm always a resource person who can help him

11
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,800
fix up some things with some people, you know, give them that which is, so yes, I'm still

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
here, I'm still not leaving now.

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:37,840
And if very soon things are, okay, when I'm ready, but I'm preparing to settle back home.
