0	9520	I love my country so much that, to me, I have to capitalise on my experience in the country
9520	15440	to see what I can bring into my country, not only in terms of governance, because I have
15440	21840	a lot of relations with people, but also in terms of business, business model.
21840	29320	There are things, I saw some things here that are working, I suggest I give the ideas to
29320	31320	some of my friends there.
31320	49880	And some have made it, it's good, it's working, by myself, I'm like, okay, so what I'm doing
49880	57280	here, you know, is media, media work and, you know, I will see continue to do that, but
57280	62800	myself, after everything, I'm also preparing myself to go back home, not really to stay
62800	70640	here for no longer, to go back home and capitalise on what I've had with relations, with everything
70640	75680	and anyone who wants to come to Nigeria, I'm always a resource person who can help him
75680	80800	fix up some things with some people, you know, give them that which is, so yes, I'm still
80800	82800	here, I'm still not leaving now.
82800	97840	And if very soon things are, okay, when I'm ready, but I'm preparing to settle back home.
