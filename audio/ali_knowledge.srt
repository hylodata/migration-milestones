1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
They are playing on the ignorance of people, you know.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,640
Maybe it's because, okay, not probably because I'm a journalist,

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,160
but because I'm a lawyer in training.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:17,520
So I know the rules, and I know that when you are in a coarser citizen,

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,680
there's nothing like payment, even to sign, you know,

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,800
to stamp your passport for you to cross, you know,

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,840
all those kinds of things, provided that you have all your documentations

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,760
and all your medical stuff, you're free to move.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,480
But they are not doing that, you know, the borders.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,840
And I always fight because I don't want to pay,

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,680
and I don't want not only me to pay,

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,440
but even people around me are telling them,

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,160
you are not paying, okay, sign this thing, let it go.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,960
I became friends with a lot of them later because, you know,

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,080
they are like, ah, Mr. Jonathan, when I come, ah, bring this thing,

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,800
you know, they go, they go, they go, they go, they go.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,800
Don't spoil it, well, you know, no, don't spoil it,

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,560
but I can't tell you, I'll tell you, go.

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,360
So...
