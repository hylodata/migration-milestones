00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
They are playing on the ignorance of people, you know.

00:03.680 --> 00:06.640
Maybe it's because, okay, not probably because I'm a journalist,

00:06.640 --> 00:08.160
but because I'm a lawyer in training.

00:08.160 --> 00:17.520
So I know the rules, and I know that when you are in a coarser citizen,

00:17.520 --> 00:21.680
there's nothing like payment, even to sign, you know,

00:21.680 --> 00:24.800
to stamp your passport for you to cross, you know,

00:24.800 --> 00:27.840
all those kinds of things, provided that you have all your documentations

00:27.920 --> 00:31.760
and all your medical stuff, you're free to move.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.480
But they are not doing that, you know, the borders.

00:34.480 --> 00:37.840
And I always fight because I don't want to pay,

00:37.840 --> 00:39.680
and I don't want not only me to pay,

00:39.680 --> 00:41.440
but even people around me are telling them,

00:41.440 --> 00:44.160
you are not paying, okay, sign this thing, let it go.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.960
I became friends with a lot of them later because, you know,

00:48.960 --> 00:52.080
they are like, ah, Mr. Jonathan, when I come, ah, bring this thing,

00:52.080 --> 00:54.800
you know, they go, they go, they go, they go, they go.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.800
Don't spoil it, well, you know, no, don't spoil it,

00:56.800 --> 00:58.560
but I can't tell you, I'll tell you, go.

00:58.560 --> 00:59.360
So...
