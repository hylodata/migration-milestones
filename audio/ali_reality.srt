1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
He gave it to one of his colleagues, not this guy, because he swore that he was not going to stamp the passport.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So he gave it to one guy that he should stamp it, and I said, okay, however, I still have a question.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I want to know, is there any law or any tariff, something about stamping the passport when people are equalized?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I want to know. He said, come, he took me to his office up there.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There's nothing. There's nothing like that. There's absolutely nothing.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What is happening is that sometimes they would even ask for ink to stamp these things, and they have to pay from their pocket.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And sometimes they are even tired of all these things, because they would ask the federal government.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
They would bring these things six months after the request, you know, and they have to do something about it.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So at the end of the day, they are like, you don't know, if people can contribute on doing this kind of thing, yes, it's not that different.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I say, oh, that's something. Seriously. See, I park my car here, I always park it here.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The boys, when I go in circles, they come back, they are here, they are washing my car.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The women wash it before I even ask, they know me now, I give them 1000, 2000.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Some of the people said, you know, immigration guys, I become friendly with them.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We'll go and have our play somewhere, and we'll eat peppers, we'll get everything, you know.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't have any problem with spending money or giving money for this kind of thing.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But I think it has to go with, you know, people have to be cultures.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Because the way he is doing it is like an obligation.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And to me, this is a frustrating.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And I wonder if this is what they are doing, they need to stop it, because it can't work.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Anyway, it is me, I'm passing there. This is always going to be a social fight,

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
because I will never pay for my passport and pass.
