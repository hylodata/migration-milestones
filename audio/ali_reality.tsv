0	6000	He gave it to one of his colleagues, not this guy, because he swore that he was not going to stamp the passport.
6000	12000	So he gave it to one guy that he should stamp it, and I said, okay, however, I still have a question.
12000	20000	I want to know, is there any law or any tariff, something about stamping the passport when people are equalized?
20000	25000	I want to know. He said, come, he took me to his office up there.
26000	31000	There's nothing. There's nothing like that. There's absolutely nothing.
31000	41000	What is happening is that sometimes they would even ask for ink to stamp these things, and they have to pay from their pocket.
41000	45000	And sometimes they are even tired of all these things, because they would ask the federal government.
45000	52000	They would bring these things six months after the request, you know, and they have to do something about it.
52000	61000	So at the end of the day, they are like, you don't know, if people can contribute on doing this kind of thing, yes, it's not that different.
61000	67000	I say, oh, that's something. Seriously. See, I park my car here, I always park it here.
67000	73000	The boys, when I go in circles, they come back, they are here, they are washing my car.
73000	78000	The women wash it before I even ask, they know me now, I give them 1000, 2000.
78000	83000	Some of the people said, you know, immigration guys, I become friendly with them.
83000	87000	We'll go and have our play somewhere, and we'll eat peppers, we'll get everything, you know.
87000	92000	I don't have any problem with spending money or giving money for this kind of thing.
92000	96000	But I think it has to go with, you know, people have to be cultures.
96000	101000	Because the way he is doing it is like an obligation.
101000	104000	And to me, this is a frustrating.
104000	109000	And I wonder if this is what they are doing, they need to stop it, because it can't work.
109000	114000	Anyway, it is me, I'm passing there. This is always going to be a social fight,
114000	118000	because I will never pay for my passport and pass.
