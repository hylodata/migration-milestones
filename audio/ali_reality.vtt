He gave it to one of his colleagues, not this guy, because he swore that he was not going to stamp the passport.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
So he gave it to one guy that he should stamp it, and I said, okay, however, I still have a question.

00:12.000 --> 00:20.000
I want to know, is there any law or any tariff, something about stamping the passport when people are equalized?

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
I want to know. He said, come, he took me to his office up there.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
There's nothing. There's nothing like that. There's absolutely nothing.

00:31.000 --> 00:41.000
What is happening is that sometimes they would even ask for ink to stamp these things, and they have to pay from their pocket.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
And sometimes they are even tired of all these things, because they would ask the federal government.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
They would bring these things six months after the request, you know, and they have to do something about it.

00:52.000 --> 01:01.000
So at the end of the day, they are like, you don't know, if people can contribute on doing this kind of thing, yes, it's not that different.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
I say, oh, that's something. Seriously. See, I park my car here, I always park it here.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
The boys, when I go in circles, they come back, they are here, they are washing my car.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
The women wash it before I even ask, they know me now, I give them 1000, 2000.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
Some of the people said, you know, immigration guys, I become friendly with them.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
We'll go and have our play somewhere, and we'll eat peppers, we'll get everything, you know.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
I don't have any problem with spending money or giving money for this kind of thing.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
But I think it has to go with, you know, people have to be cultures.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
Because the way he is doing it is like an obligation.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
And to me, this is a frustrating.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
And I wonder if this is what they are doing, they need to stop it, because it can't work.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
Anyway, it is me, I'm passing there. This is always going to be a social fight,

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
because I will never pay for my passport and pass.
