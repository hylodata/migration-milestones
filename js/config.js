She also knew various people who traveled to work across more distant parts of the region, including an uncle who had moved to Lagos, Nigeria. The prospect of travel had frequently presented itself, and Patience dreamed of leaving Hohoe and living in a big city. In 2002, an opportunity arose when her uncle visited for Christmas and invited her to come to Lagos after graduating from Secondary School. He promised to provide both accommodation and employment for her in his shop."

Her parents gave her money for a journey across countries, and her uncle sent instructions detailing how to get from Hohoe to Lagos. He advised her to acquire a passport and a yellow fever vaccination certificate, neither of which was difficult to get. She also needed to pool together enough money for her transportation, feeding, and various unforeseen expenses such as border-crossing fees. Patience would need to cross three borders to get to Lagos."

Trotro are privately owned minibuses, minivans, and pickup trucks that operate like shared taxis, traveling fixed routes and leaving only when filled to capacity. Trotros are often crowded and can be uncomfortable, yet provide a convenient and affordable mode of transportation. Patience recalls that she didn't have any problem crossing the border because she had both the right documents and money to pay a border-crossing fee. Entering Togo was her first time in another country, and she recalls being surprised about having to pay money at the border even though she was told to expect it. She was nervous about traveling alone, but was also very excited to see what was beyond the border."

            description: "Patience used to send money home to her family, but she is no longer able to do so because of an economic downturn. She makes it a priority to visit Ghana, though, since she's not able to send as much money as before. Currently, her work is the only thing keeping her in Lagos. If she had a chance, she would return to home now that all of her family is back in Ghana. She also feels that Ghana has greater access to amenities like electricity, water, and security, although she thinks that food is cheaper and better in Nigeria. For now, Patience believes she will remain in Lagos despite the challenges she faces in settling and doing business there."

These are challenges that are everywhere. Even in my own place in Ghana, you can get insulted for not being an indigene. But if you know what you want, you close your eyes and face it. I tried to bring people from Ghana to work with me here, but they don't want to come to Nigeria. They are afraid. I was also afraid of Nigeria before I came here, but after I decided to come here, I realized there was no harm in trying. I close my eyes and keep going. They say if you stay in Nigeria, there is no place in this world that you cannot stay.”</i>"
