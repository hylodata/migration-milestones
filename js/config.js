Trotros are often crowded, may be uncomfortable, yet a very convenient and cheap mode of transportation.   She recalls that she didn’t have any problem crossing the border because she had the right documents and she also money on her when she was asked to pay a fee at the border.  This was her first time in another country. She recounts being surprised about paying money at the border even though she was told to expect this. She was nervous about traveling alone but very excited to see what was beyond the border."

There is both a formal and informal border between Krake and Seme and entry and exit at the formal border is possible  for Patience because of her passport.  Having a passport determines how one crosses the border. People with passports can enter with cars or on foot, whereas, those without passports often rely on informal paths on okada (public bike transportation) or on foot."

He was well known for his trendy styles in Lagos; she liked the style of his work and wanted to learn it and bring it back to Ghana. He agreed to accept her as his apprentice. By 2012, when she embarked on the journey back to Lagos, she finds that travel requirements have changed since she left. There are more check points both between Ghana and Togo, Togo and Benin, as well as Benin and Nigeria. More check points meant stricter immigration procedures, as well as higher fees to pay to border officials."

            description: "“I do not face discrimination but sometimes, I have been told I am a foreigner, and some people do things to frustrate me, especially if they know you do not have networks or family to support you. These are challenges that are everywhere, even in my own place in Ghana— you can get insulted for not being an indigene even in Ghana. But if you know what you want, you close your eyes and face it. I tried to bring people from Ghana to work with me here, but they don’t want to come to Nigeria. They are afraid. I was also afraid of Nigeria before I came here but after I decided to come here, I realized there was no harm in trying. I close my eyes and keep going. They say if you stay in Nigeria, there is no place in this world that you cannot stay.”"
