                        Kelvin is from the town of <strong class="strongMilestone">Aného</strong>, located in southeast Togo in Lacs Prefecture, Maritime Region. He was in his sophomore year at the University of <strong class="strongMilestone">Lomé</strong> during the Presidential elections on April 24, 2005. The elections took place on a Sunday, and violence broke out in the Togolese capital after a winner was announced.

                        Kelvin got a call from a friend early on the following Monday asking him to leave campus because votes were not counted and fighting had led to the deaths of some people. Because movement was expected to be impossible by the next day, Kelvin was advised to leave immediately. He left campus and headed out of the capital by 4 AM Monday morning.

                        A friend took Kelvin on his bike to the Mono River between Togo and Benin, about 70 km east of Lomé, and dropped him there.

The man that carried him to Seme bought the phone from him, paying for it in CFA, which Kelvin then had to convert to Naira. He had contacts in Nigeria, so he called them to tell them he was coming.

                        Kelvin stayed in <strong class="strongMilestone">Ikotun</strong>, a neighbourhood on the mainland, located in Alimosho Local Government Area in Lagos State. Kelvin struggled to find a job because he was not fluent in English, so he stayed home for months. He began to try to make friends in order to find opportunities, befriending a group of bricklayers and working two gigs on construction sites. He eventually got the contact of a teacher at Queen Maris College in Ikotun who was looking for someone fluent in French to help with a French language book publication. Kelvin started working with him, and they published a book called <i>Ça y est</i> which means "That's it." The teacher introduced Kelvin to a few schools, and Kelvin started to teach French part-time.
